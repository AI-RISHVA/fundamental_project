# TASK 2

# Q1: Write a program that will give you in hand monthly salary after deduction on CTC
# HRA(10%), DA(5%), PF(3%) and taxes deduction as below:
# Salary(Lakhs) : Tax(%)
# Below 5 : 0%
# 5-10 : 10%
# 10-20 : 20%
# above 20 : 30%

# code


# Q2: Write a program that take a user input of three angles and will find out whether it can form a triangle or not.

# code


# Q3: Write a program that will take user input of cost price and selling price and determines whether its a loss or a profit.

# code


# Q4: Write a menu-driven program
# 1. cm to ft
# 2. km to miles

# 4. exit

# code


# Q5: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms.
# The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
# The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
# Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

# code


# Q6: Find the factorial of a given number using a loop.
# The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.
# Example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

# code


# Q7: Reverse a given integer number.
# Example: Input: 76542 , Output: 24567

# code


# Q8: Take a user input as integer N. Find out the sum from 1 to N.
# If any number is divisible by 5, then skip that number.
# And if the sum is greater than 300, don't need to calculate the sum further.
# Print the final result. And don't use for loop to solve this problem.
# Example: Input: 30 , Output: 276

# code


# Q9: Write a program that keeps on accepting a number from the user until the user enters Zero.
# Display the sum and average of all the numbers.

# code


# Q10: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# code


# Q11: Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included)
# such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a space-separated sequence on a single line.

# code


# Q12: A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0).
# The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.
# Example Input:
# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3
# RIGHT 2
# !
# Compute the distance from current position to original point.
# If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
# Example Output: 2

# code


# Q13: Write a program to print whether a given number is a prime number or not.

# code


# Q14: Print all the Armstrong numbers in a given range. Range will be provided by the user.
# Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
# Example: 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are Armstrong numbers.

# code


# Q15: Calculate the angle between the hour hand and minute hand.
# Print the minimum of the two angles (floor value).
# Example: H = 9, M = 0 , Output: 90

# code


# Q16: Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.
# A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points:
# the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle.
# Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping.
